Project written by creating custom [Gymnasium]([https://www.google.com](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environment.

Instructions:
1. Clone this project.
2. Use build.bat to install envs (i messed some paths, and I don't have the time or inclination to correct it)
3. Cd into Patro_Car directory and run with "python run.py"

Environment has few attributes to modify:
game_fps (default=300) - if ```python render=True``` define speed of game clock<br/>
rotation_amount (default=6)<br/>
max_speed (default=4)<br/>
acceleration_amount (default=0.1)<br/>
